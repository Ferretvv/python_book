# Challenge: This program uses a bit of math. Don't let that scare you away -- try it anyway.
# Assume you have $1,000.00 in the bank, and you've somehow managed 
# to find a bank that pays you 5% (this is a wish-fulfillment fantasy)
#  compounded interest every year. After one year, you will have $1,050 
# ($1,000 times 1.05). After two years, you will have $1,050 times 1.05, 
# or $1102.50. Create a variable named balance that contains the amount 
# of money you will have after 5 years, then print the result. Use a 
# single expression if you can to set balance to the correct value.
balance = 1000
year = 1
while year < 6:
    balance = balance * 1.05
    year += 1
print(f"Your balance after five years is: ${balance: .2f}")
# I didn't read the last line teehee. Launchschool prefers:
# balance = (1000.00 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05)
# print(balance)
